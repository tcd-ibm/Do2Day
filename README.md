# Do2Day
## Overview
Do2Day is a TODO application built using a CI/CD pipeline.

## Architectural Decisions
Below are the architectural decisions we encountered over the course of the project, the solutions we
considered and the ultimate decision we made to solve the issue. These architectural decisions have
been created using the architecture decision description template published in
["Architecture Decisions: Demystifying Architecture" by Jeff Tyree and Art Akerman, Capital One Financial]
(https://www.utdallas.edu/~chung/SA/zz-Impreso-architecture_decisions-tyree-05.pdf). These templates are
active documents are will be updated as and when architectural decisions are made or changed over the
course of the project.
